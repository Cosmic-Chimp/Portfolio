I've finished my first course about coding. On February the second, I completed Coursera's course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" with a 100% for all my assignments. That's when I first started becoming excited about coding because it's when I realized that I could at least do some of the things involved with coding. </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> <div class="row row-1"> <section> <div class="ball"></div> <div class="details"> <span class="title">🖥️&nbsp;CodeCademy</span> <span>5th February 2021</span> </div> <p> After completing the previously mentioned course from Coursera, I started learning to code through Codecademy. I joined them in December of 2020 but didn't start with the Fullstack course yet, as I wanted to complete what I had started with on Coursera. <br> The first few classes on CodeCademy were very different from Coursera, and much more difficult, but me being the person that I am, I saw it as a challenge and it piqued my interest even more. </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> <div class="row row-2"> <section> <div class="ball"></div> <div class="details"> <span class="title">⚠️&nbsp; First Fun but Challenging project</span> <span>7th April 2021</span> </div> <p> On this day I completed a project which caused me a lot of headaches at the time. Project name = Mixed Messages. <br> The goal for this project was to use my javascript skills to make a random string generator that pulls data from three different sources. The three different sources I used are three arrays. One with jokes, one with songs, and one with funny quotes I got from the internet that are generated by A.I. The project's tasks did not include the need to use HTML and CSS, but I incorporated these technologies to challenge my skills. </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> <div class="row row-1"> <section> <div class="ball"></div> <div class="details"> <span class="title">🧪&nbsp; Experimenting with Sass</span> <span>31st May 2021</span> </div> <p> I started playing around with Sass when I started building my portfolio <br> In the beginning it was tough to understand how it works and getting it to compile to vanilla CSS but when i got the hang of it, I started to realize how dynamic and fun it can be to work with Sass.The ability to use mixins for media queries is what made me the most excited because rewriting the same boilerplate code to make an app responsive was a tedious adventure and it doesn really follow the principles of DRY. </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> <div class="row row-2"> <section> <div class="ball"></div> <div class="details"> <span class="title">💪 &nbsp;ReactJs === Unlimited POWER!</span> <span>2 June 2021</span> </div> <p> After a while I started learning about ReactJs and how to build apps with it <br> In the beginning React was extremely difficult to comprehend but after 6 months of experience with building my own projects with it I realized how beneficial it is and how much it bring to the table. The virtual-dom is in and of itself a MAJOR benefit when it comes to perfomance on the web. </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> <div class="row row-1"> <section> <div class="ball"></div> <div class="details"> <span class="title">🤯&nbsp;Framer-Motion, Mind = Blown</span> <span>Mid December 2021</span> </div> <p> I recently decided to practise my skills with React and the use of API's.I decided to go with using NASA's APOD API. <br> I went with the idea of mimicking the experience of a ufo or more recently dubbed "UAP" that takes the user to space and provides them with information given by the chosen API. After a while I realized that writing animations in vanilla CSS is quite a tedious and repititive process. So I chose to use a third party animation library called "Framer-Motion". </p> <p>Learning to use the Framer-Motion api has greatly improved my ability to write animations for components and I highly recommend this tool to everyone who is interested in writing cleaner and more intuitive animations for react components. </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> <div class="row row-2"> <section> <div class="ball"></div> <div class="details"> <span class="title">🔮 &nbsp; What the future holds</span> <span>Let me know</span> </div> <p> A bunch of next level projects <br> <br> &amp; <br> <br> Potentially joining YOUR company to work on solutions😎 </p> <div class="bottom">  </div> </section> </div> </div> </div>  <section id="about"></section> <div class="aboutMe"> <div class="jhead"><h1 class="empha">Who am I?</h1></div> <div class="box"> <div class="abt"> <h2 id="abtH2">About Me</h2> <p> <li>👋 Hi, I’m Rueben aka @Cosmic-Chimp</li> <li>📘 I’ve been studying online for the past 2 years and I am very keen on joining the web-dev job market</li> <li>🧠 I’m always happy to learn new things and I'm super excited about how the tech world is progressing</li> <li>👀 I’m interested in improving my life aswell as other people's lives through the use of technology</li> <li>🥅 My goal for this year is to become better with JavaScript, Sass, ReactJs and and to start learning about backend-development</li> <li>🕹️ Fun fact about me: I love gaming and plan on making my own platform game somewhere in the future with UNITY</li> </p> </div> </div> </div>  <section id="contact"></section> <div class="formCont"> <div class="form"> <div class="contact-info"> <h3 class="touch">Get in touch</h3> <p class="text"> If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me </p> <div class="info"> <div class="information"> <img src="email.24079725.png" class="icon" alt=""> <p>rubzdebruyn@gmail.com</p> </div> <div class="information"> <img src="phone.6658bf7b.png" class="icon" alt=""> <p>076-754-9915</p> </div> </div> <div class="social-media"> <p>Connect with me :</p> <div class="social-icons">  --> <a class="smIcons" href="https://github.com/Cosmic-Chimp" target="_blank"><img src="iconmonstr-github-1.3f3f4181.svg" alt="github-Link"></a> <a class="smIcons" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rueben-schoeman-1276861a0/" target="_blank"><img src="iconmonstr-linkedin-4.324c29a6.svg" alt="linkedin-Link"></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="contact-form"> <span class="circle one"></span> <span class="circle two"></span> <form action="http://localhost/portfolioform/contactForm.php" method="POST" id="form">  <h3 class="ctctMe">Contact Me</h3> <div class="input-container"> <input id="userName" type="text" placeholder="Your Name" name="name" class="input"> <i class="fa-check-circle fas"></i> <i class="fa-exclamation-circle fas"></i> <small>Error message</small> <label for=""></label> </div> <div class="input-container"> <input id="Email" type="email" placeholder="Your Email" name="email" class="input"> <i class="fa-check-circle fas"></i> <i class="fa-exclamation-circle fas"></i> <small>Error message</small> <label for=""></label> </div> <div class="input-container textarea"> <textarea name="message" class="input"></textarea> <label for=""></label> </div> <button type="submit" name="submit" class="btn">Send Mail</button> </form> </div> </div> </div>  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll@15.0.0/dist/smooth-scroll.polyfills.min.js"></script> <script src="main.26dce787.js"></script>  <script src="https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.min.js"></script>  <script>var e=new Swiper(".mySwiper",{effect:"cube",grabCursor:!0,slidesPerView:1,spaceBetween:30,loop:!1,cubeEffect:{shadow:!1},navigation:{nextEl:".swiper-button-next",prevEl:".swiper-button-prev"},pagination:{el:".swiper-pagination",clickable:!0}});</script> </body></html>
